                <p>This sensation. I know it all too well. There's no doubt. I'm being watched. </p>
                <br/>
                <p>Don't tell me there's an enemy among the crowd. No, that's not it. I'm not the only one they're watching. And it's not just idle curiosity about this crowd either. It's like they're probing us. What an unpleasant gaze. But still...they must be amateurs. <br/>
                There!<br/> Four on the walkway overhead. Three on the bell tower and even more in the buildings to our sides. I've already memorized the list of people associated with the school..Faculty Members! He's taking notes...while the man beside him speaks into a commuicator... Not to mention the surveillance.n In other words...
                The test has already started!<br/>
                They're most likely watching and grading our every action. Judging us as worthy or unworthy. "Focus you two. The examiners are watching us. Just stay calm like we practiced."<br/>
                This year's applicants are a disappointment. They lack elegance. Every last one of them. Even allowing this rabble to set foot into our campus bothers me.Tradition is born of elegance. Elegace transforms this profane world into paradise. <br/>
                Disqualify all of these boorish families. <br/>"Sir!"<br/>
                "hmm..?"It's faint but I do detect a trae of elegance from them. <br/>The headmaster watches as the family stops in front of the statue towering over the applicants as they enter the academy's gounds. "What!?" They're saluting the statue of the founding headmaster?!<br/>
                I am Twilight. The man with a thousand faces. I'll honor your tradition. Being exactly who you want me to be is child's play. (Loid) I have no idea who this man is. But it should all work out as long as I follow Loid's lead.(Yor) Bald teapot (Anya) <br/>
                ELEGANT! Quelle Elegance! Who is that family?! Do these people possess true elegance? Or are they yet more rabble? The Forgers come upon the first test of the interview. A young boy has become stuck in a gutter. ...Even for a test, isn't this a bit too obvious? The others must think so too, because no one's getting near him. But, if this is a test, we'll just have to pass it. <br/>
                "Mama, Papa, That boy is not all in order! Lettuce help him!" bThe boy flails, splishing muddy water all around him. Any attempt to pull him out of the gutter will surely result in getting dirty. That's right. You can't very well show up to the interview with your clothes covered in dirty water, now can you? Now then, how will you extract him with elegance?<br/>
                *Loid steps into the muddy water, grabs the boy's arm, and pulls him out in one smooth motion. Covering himself ad his family with mud in the process.*<br/>
                Hmph. I was expecting too much of them. In the end, he's just another peasant. As if we'd allow an applicant covered in mud to disgrace our campus. "Escort K-212 off the grounds."<br/>
                "Good thing I thought something like this may happen and prepared an extra set of clothes." You thought this might happen?! Who would think that? They're even sparing the boy's feelings! How clever! Elegant and clever!

            Hero who casts no shadow, the great deeds you and your fellow agents do shall never see the light of day. You will never earn any medals nor make it into the papers. But even so, never forget that everyone else's day-to-day lives are possible because of your blood, sweat, and tears. <br/>
            Regarding our approach towards earning stellas to become a star scholar i the first place, this part of the plan to attend the meeting strictly speaking, it doesn't necessarily need to be grades but other achievements could suffice. The most reliable method would be to go directly there and steal the answers but we need to avoid getting too many tonitruse bolts and being exposed. In contrst, according to other agents in the past few years there have been increasingly less students earning stealla. So given that, steadily increasing her results with a focus on her academics and study skills. In the event that she fails, the correct route would be... In the worst case scenario, I can sneak into the faculty room and change her grades.

Title: Eden Academy Entrance Interview Simulation Report <br/>
Author: L. Forger (Handler Review: “Gardenia”)
Operation ID: STRIX-PARENTAL-INTEGRATION-PHASE I
Last Modified: 2025-04-20 22:46:13
Security Clearance: WISE-3 or higher<br/>

Simulation Overview:<br/>

This report compiles behavioral simulations, question-response matrices, and emotional conditioning exercises designed to prepare the “Forger Unit” for Eden Academy’s parent-child entrance interview.<br/>

Summary:<br/>

The Eden Interview Panel demonstrates high sensitivity to:<br/>
  - Sincerity in family dynamics.
  - Composure under pressure or personal provocation.
  - Child’s behavioral response to stress, disappointment, and etiquette prompts.<br/>

Failure to maintain the illusion of a stable, elite family unit may result in immediate disqualification, followed by social blacklisting.<br/>

Test Scenarios:<br/>

Scenario 03A: “Mock Emotional Distress”
  • Trigger: Interviewer insults Yor’s social standing.
  • Response Matrix:
      - Loid: Calm deflection, redirect to Yor’s “charity work” and “war widower empathy.”
      - Yor: Breath regulation exercise activated. Do not reach for cutlery.<br/>

Scenario 07C: “Anya Emotional Spiral”<br/>
  • Trigger: Anya incorrectly answers a knowledge question.
  • Response Protocol:<br/>
      - Loid applies soft correction.
      - Hand squeeze = coded reassurance.<br/>
      - “Elegant mistake” framing to preserve morale.

Scenario 10Z: “Unexpected Question: ‘What is Love?’”<br/>
  • Target: Anya<br/>
  • Simulated Answers:<br/>
      - "It’s when Papa and Mama make pancakes together." <br/>
      - "It’s when Mama doesn’t use poison at dinner." <br/>

Psychological Reinforcement Plan:<br/>

  - Weekly Mock Interviews (Mon/Wed/Fri, 18:00–18:45)<br/>
  - Affection Simulation Module (coded "PDA Protocol–Beta")<br/>
  - Anya Memory Boosting Exercises disguised as cartoon quizzes<br/>

Notes:<br/>

  - Handler’s feedback indicates a 14% uptick in panel bias toward children<br/>
    who display independent articulation and basic empathy.<br/>
  - Further reduce Loid's speech formalities by 12%. <br/>
    Add mild verbal affection (test phrases: “champ,” “sport,” “my bright star”).<br/>
