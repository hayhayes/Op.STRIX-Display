# Operation STRIX

**Operation STRIX** (Super Terrific Really Incredible Experience) is a modern, front-end web application built using React and Vite. 
This project is designed as an event display. The two displays produce non-interactive pages with css animations to create the illusion of ongoing data collection. Currently one page produces an interactive component that encodes a message into an emoji cipher. This interaction was designed to target children with a short and fun activity. 

## Features
